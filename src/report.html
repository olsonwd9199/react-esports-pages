1. We made the website for the president of the UWEC esports
    Mikinley Prafke because we are both palying for and
    interested in esports.

2. The site has a header as a nav bar that spans the top of
    the page

3. The side has more than 10 pages. 8 game pages, a home
    page, 3 form pages, a lab page, an about page, a contact
    page, and a social media page/footer

4. the site has a nav bar and links to easily navigate the 
    site

5. The page reacts to changes in size using media queries
    and things switch to column when it gets small enough

6. The site has a consistant style for the home page and
    for all of the game pages that have their own style 
    sheet

7. The site contains pleanty of images in both the home
    page and game pages with accurate descriptions

8. The whole site utalizes a blugold themed favicon which was
    set up through react

9. images were placed in an image folder, css for main and
    games were put in a css folder, and all the java script 
    folders were components so they were put in the components
    folder. Any files not in those folders are the main 
    drivers of the site.

10. We used bootstrap, react, firestore, and git

11. the custom within react and components which are either
    function or class components is to have an uppercase 
    name with them so we stuck with that. All other
    files are lowercase.

12. all of the content on the site is alligned in a good
    way being centered or left oriented.

13. The heading and the bodys use the traditional font 
    styling

14. Our client requested a contact form, feedback form, and 
    a interest check form which all submit data to a 
    firestore database

15. The social media area at the bottom of the home page
    provides links to the youtube, twitch, facebook and 
    discord page for the esports club

16. All of the code is very readable and easy to follow 
    using react standards.

17. The site uses an animation for the headers of all the 
    game pages where the text fades in. This was powered
    using css.

18. We used a firestore database to get and retrive data
    within the site(see attached video)

19. doesn't apply

20. addressed some of the feedback like changing the font 
    colors, fixing the backround images on the homepage
    to not repeat, adding more info about the games, adding
    links to individual discord servers, andadding interesting
    forms.

critique:
    Mikinley was pretty excited to see the final project 
    after all this time. He had a big part in planning it 
    and has honestly done so much for the esports club
    here on campus. He likes how easy it was to get to the 
    discord pages because that is where most of the club
    opperates. He also liked the showcase of each game in the 
    club. One thing he think we could add later is a calander
    with esports events and games on it.

comments:
    A lot of the comments from classmates were related to 
    the colors and appearnce of the page. A common theme 
    was that the colors and text were very harsh. We fixed
    this by switching to lighter colors for the pages and
    switching text and background colors. Another comment
    was that there was a lot of open space which has since
    been filled with more content. The only other concerns
    were the background images for the homepage which has been 
    fixed

forms:
    all ofthe formes are accessable from the home page and 
    appear below the nav bar when clicked on. We have a 
    contact, feedback, and interest form avalable right now.
    We had a schedule form in but our client asked us to take 
    it out becuase it didn't make sense because teams make 
    their own schedules so that is why there are only three.
